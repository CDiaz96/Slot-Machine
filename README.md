Tech used: HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript

How It's Made: When creating this website I focused on making it functional first before I went in and applied the CSS.I created the basic layout on HTML with a form, two buttons, and empty image tags with each reel.I targeted each image tag in Javascript and applied a Math.random in order to randomize each of the images when the player put in their bets.

Lessons Learned: Through this project I was able to hone in my javascript skills and figure out ways to simplify the functions while accomplishing my goal. One thing in particular I struggled with at first, but soon better understood was implementing the Math.random to each reel in order for it to randomize the images.
